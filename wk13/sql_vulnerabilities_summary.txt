G. Testing and Exploiting SQL Vulnerabilities

1. On typing 'Ben', no result was displayed; this is as expected since this user has 0 as his active value while the query searches for 1 active values.

2. On typing 'Ben'-- ', the user 'ben' was displayed which is not as expected since the query is only users whose active value is 1.


3. 1. On typing 'Benâ€™ or 1=1', no result was displayed; this is as expected since this user has 0 as his active value while the query searches for 1 active values.



H. Mitigate SQL Injections

Observations:

In all 3 scenarios, no results were displayed.
Prepared statement sanitized the input 'Ben'-- ' and closed the loophole of returning unexpected results.
